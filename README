To get the PINtools to compile you need to set the PIN_ROOT variable to where you have PIN installed.
e.g. export PIN_ROOT=~/Downloads/pin 
You also need to add your zeromq library to your $PIN_TOOL/source/tools/Config/makefile.unix.config
e.g. TOOL_PATHS = -L/usr/local/lib and TOOL_LIBS += -ldwarf -lelf -ldl -lzmq
