\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}
The presented approach paves the way for many more useful improvements and extensions on numerous facets and
aspects of \xmlmate. This section gives a brief overview of some of the most interesting future work items.
\begin{itemize}
\item[]One particularly large work item is completely rewriting the genetic algorithm of \xmlmate from scratch
aiming for better parallelization support from the beginning. At the time of writing it is estimated that this
goal is best achieved by making heavy use of many of the features that the {\small
Scala}\cite{scala-overview-tech-report} programming language has to offer, as well as utilizing the {\small
Akka} actor-based message-driven concurrency framework\cite{Wyatt:2013:AC:2663429} to make \xmlmate fully
concurrent and distributed.
\item[]To make better use of the available computational resources, the genetic algorithm at the heart of
\xmlmate can profit from the addition of meta-heuristics that would govern the number of instances of certain
subprocesses like format converters or worker nodes during runtime based on the proportion of their
respective load on the system.
\item[]Delving deeper into the use case of finding vulnerabilities, it might be wise to further investigate
the mechanism responsible for generating aberrant and unexpected input values and extend it to work not only
with integer and floating point types, but other types and even structures permissible in \xml as well.
\item[]Since \xmlmate provides an interface for pluggable fitness functions, it is only natural to want to try
out more of them. Some next candidates would be the branch coverage fitness function as implemented in
\evosuite in the context of generating test suites, and for program resilience testing purposes a fitness
function that aims to maximize the number of context switches in a concurrent program seems interesting for
finding multi-threading related issues such as deadlocks, livelocks, starvation and the like.
\item[]For future fitness functions that use program performance values in the computation of their
fitness score it is possible to significantly increase efficiency by making use of hardware performance
counters, which are provided by modern hardware and can be directly accessed in most operating systems by
means of special APIs like the one provided by the {\small PAPI}\cite{Mucci99papi:a} library. Note that
this would impose a limitation on the concurrent use of \xmlmate on a single machine; however, this limitation
can probably be solved by using virtualization techniques like {\small Docker}\cite{docker} and {\small
Vagrant}\cite{vagrant} - especially since \xmlmate is now a distributed system capable of running across
multiple heterogeneous nodes.
\item[]If \xmlmate is going to be used in truly distributed systems, it is probably a good idea to replace
the currently employed \msgpack message serialization and deserialization engine by another, more efficient and
sophisticated library. When real network traffic is involved, it seems like a good idea to minimize the amount
of traffic that has to pass through the network, and having a library with a streaming interface that also
allows to deserialize messages before they have reached their destination completely is certainly also of
good use as well. Some candidate replacements can be found in \cref{sec:msgpack}.
\item[]With more fitness functions come more test subjects that can be explored. For formats, for which the
corresponding schemas and converters already exist in the current version, such applications as \emph{tcpdump}
and \emph{tshark} for the \pcap format and a whole
lot\footnote{\url{http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngapcv.html}} of programs for {\small png} are available.
\item[]Adding test subjects that process other file formats requires adding new schemas and converters that
support them. Some envisioned targets are \emph{libjpeg}, \emph{giflib} and \emph{libflac} libraries for
processing image, animation and sound files, respectively.
\item[]In terms of usability and convenience \xmlmate could profit from minimizing the files responsible for
revealing a defect in the application under test using delta debugging\cite{zeller2002simplifying} to make it
easier for the user to find the actual cause of the failure in question.
\item[]Ending on another big topic, seeing as \xmlmate has its origins in the \java world, it could be extended
to support testing of \java applications that use native code by performing instrumentation on both \java
byte code and the native binary code.

% add electric fence? (maybe to the same item as PAPI)
% add multiplatform support? (windows?)
% add reliability protocol? (on top of zmq)
