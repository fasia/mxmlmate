\section*{Abstract}
%%%Motivation - want find vulns when autotesting
When generating test inputs with the goal of revealing failures and vulnerabilities in a program, 
%%%Problem - inputs must be well-formed
the inputs must adhere to a format specific to this program, otherwise they are 
quickly discarded without getting anywhere near executing important logic code.
%%%Methodology - grammars + search-based + specific criteria
Several techniques can be used to profitably apply automated test input generation in this usage scenario -
they include leveraging format description grammars, employing search-based instance development algorithms,
and utilizing guidance criteria specifically designed for individual vulnerability classes.
%%%Results - prototype, subjects, failures
A prototypical implementation extending the search-based input generator \emph{XMLMate} with the suggested
techniques has been applied to several file formats and their corresponding libraries and has shown promise as
it detected failures, which have been confirmed as vulnerabilities.
%%%Optional - more details on subjects and their vulnerabilities
