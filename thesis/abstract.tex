\section*{Abstract}
%%%Motivation - want find vulns when autotesting
When generating test inputs with the goal of revealing failures and vulnerabilities in a program, 
%%%Problem - inputs must be well-formed
the inputs must adhere to a format specific to this program, otherwise they are 
quickly discarded without getting anywhere near executing importnat code responsible for program logic.
%%%Methodology - grammars + search-based + specific criteria
Several techniques can be used to profitably apply automated test input generation in this usage scenario -
they include leveraging format description grammars, employing search-based instance development algorithms,
and utilizing guidance criteria specifically designed for individual vulnerability classes.
%%%Results - prototype, subjects, failures
A prototypical implementation extending the search-based input generator \emph{XMLMate} with the suggested
techniques has been applied to several file formats and their corresponding libraries and has shown promise as
it detected defects, some of which are classified as security threats in the database of common
vulnerabilities and exposures. 
%%%Optional - more details on subjects and their vulnerabilities
