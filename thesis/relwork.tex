\subsection{Search-Based Testing}
In the category of search-based approaches, i.e. those that employ any form of guidance criteria to steer the
generation of test data in the desired direction, there are approaches spiritually very close to \xmlmate.

\evosuite{}\cite{fraser2013whole} is an entire independent unit test generator aimed at \java programs. By
dynamically observing the execution of the application under test and aiming for a maximum code coverage, it
utilizes a genetic algorithm to generate entire JUnit test suites. It provides multiple code coverage
criteria as search goals, which makes it a very versatile tool. In fact, the implementation of \xmlmate is
in part based on \evosuite.

Exsyst \cite{gross-issta2012} is also based on \evosuite, however, it specializes in testing of \java GUI
applications by evolving series of interactions that aim to explore and test as many of the program's features
as possible. % -> system testing
