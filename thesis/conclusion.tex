\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\xmlmate is an effective search-based utility for finding defects that induce crashes in the tested program. It
has become especially versatile after being enhanced with several extensions:
% list extensions: support for binaries, pluggable fitfuncs, additional formats, schema violations

The part of the genetic algorithm responsible for fitness score representation has profited from adding
support for both pluggable and vulnerability-specific fitness functions. Through this new interface \xmlmate
has gained the ability to produce fitness scores for arbitrary binaries as it is no longer confined to
the \java Virtual Machine, on which it is running itself. 

By leveraging various file format specifications and
providing converters for those formats, it has now become possible to generate inputs compatible with a wide
variety of potential test subjects which were previously inaccessible. 

Additionally, for purposes of security testing, the main
functionality of the input generation engine has been extended to enable occasional intentional specification
deviations.
This mechanism has proved to be a worthwhile enhancement in many cases.

Equipped with these additions, \xmlmate was able to reliably and repeatedly identify known vulnerabilities in
a ubiquitously used library, while maintaining a zero false positives rate by design.
Its practicability is further emphasized by the fact that it has found previously unknown defects in programs
which were not even specifically targeted in the experiments. 
It must be also noted, however, that the results are highly dependent on the quality of the user provided
schema and test driver.
